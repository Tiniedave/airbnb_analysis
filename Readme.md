Project Overview
I will be performing an analysis on a Seattle Airbnb Dataset using the CRISP-DM method.


I will be trying to answer the following questions â€”
1) What are the most popular Property and Room Types listed?
2) What is the average price for a Listing based on Property Type, Room Type, Number of Guests, and Number of Bedrooms?
3) Is it possible to predict the price of listings and what are the most important features in determining the price?

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Seaborn

Data Overview
The dataset was obtained from Insideairbnb.com. It contains:
Listings, including full descriptions and average review score.
Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments.
Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day.
I would work majorly with the Listings Dataset. It has 3818 rows and 92 columns.

Results are discussed in a Medium blog available at the following link:
